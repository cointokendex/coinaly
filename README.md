[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jvandenaardweg/coinaly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jvandenaardweg/coinaly)

Fast and easy to use mobile trade interface for cryptocurrencies. Track your trades to the moon and beyond. Are my coins taking off or crashing down? Better insights in your cryptocurrency endeavours.

Alpha site: https://coinaly.io (synced with the `master` branche)

**Important:**
This project is in the very early development stage, some features might not work yet. Progress for the first beta release can be tracked here: [github.com/jvandenaardweg/coinaly/projects/1](https://github.com/jvandenaardweg/coinaly/projects/1)

We currently only support Bittrex. We plan on adding more exchanges in the future.

## üì± Our mission
We are here to create a fast and easy to use mobile (website) trade and portfolio interface for your favorite exchange. No more missed opportunities or trades because the website of your favorite exchange is too slow or too complicated to use. We optimize our website for easy mobile usage and give you the tools and insights you need on a daily basis. It‚Äôs more about you and your trades, and less about the exchange pushing you to buy coins.

## üöÄ Features
- Optimized for mobile screens and fast mobile performance
- Instantly see the current status of your balances and orders. Am I making a profit? Or am I losing money?
- Fast selling and buying. Instantly react on market movements and quickly sell or buy a crypto coin (in progress)
- Overview open orders. How are my orders performing? Should I cancel or adjust them?
- Easily see how far an open order is from the current market price
- Better live candlestick chart by [TradingView.com](https://www.tradingview.com/)
- Live updates all market data. No need to refresh yourself
- Easily browse and filter all available markets

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Javascript devs wanted
We are currently looking for Javascript developers to speed up the development process, so we can add more exchanges in the near future. Preferably we are looking for skilled developers with professional VueJS en NodeJS experience. If you don‚Äôt fit that description, but you still want to help us out? That‚Äôs awesome! Please contact [Jordy](https://github.com/jvandenaardweg) directly or send him a message in our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/coinaly/shared_invite/enQtMjk1OTcxMTc2MTE4LWJjMzJkOTg2ODY4MzI4MzRiNmMxNmRlODY1OWZjNjA0MGVlOWFkNGJiNjMyYjNhNzRjMjY4YmI2MzI5MTFiMzg).

## üîì Bittrex API permissions
In order to use this you need to have a Bittrex API key so we can read your orders and balances. An Bittrex API key can be created here: [https://bittrex.com/Manage#sectionApi](https://bittrex.com/Manage#sectionApi). After creating, please remember the `key` and `secret`. We need that later in the setup.

* **Read info** (required: ON) is the minimum required permission that needs to be enabled. Se we can read and display your balances and order history.
* **Trade limit** (optional: ON) is only required if you want to trade from within the website.
* **Trade market** (optional: ON) is only required if you want to trade from within the website.
* **Withdrawal** (required: OFF) we don't need this, so you can leave that one off.

## üí∞ Fuel our efforts
We are a hard working bunch of people and are not affiliated with Bittrex in any way. We are just using our spare time to create a better mobile experience for what we love to do: trading cryptocurrencies.
